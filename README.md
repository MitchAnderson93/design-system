# Queensland Design System

READ ME

--- Development ---

1. Sub heading: “This is a [stage] version and is not production ready”
2. Leading paragraph: “If you are using assets from this Repo, please send an email to [development team email] so we can add you to our change management communications list“
(see example here: GitHub - qld-gov-au/qg-web-template: https://qld-gov-au.github.io/qg-web-template/?path=/docs/welcome--page)
2. An attached MIT (basic) licence with “THIS REPOSITORY (SOFTWARE) IS PROVIDED AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY” - not currently used but I think we should move towards having appropriate license files
3. An optional paragraph regarding repo branches/explaining which branch is what (see SWE example above)
